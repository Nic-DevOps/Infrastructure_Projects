# Project 4: Local VM + Ansible
This project provisions a local virtual machine using Vagrant and configures it using Ansible instead of traditional shell scripts. It introduces core configuration management principles such as idempotency, use of inventory files, and task-based provisioning with Ansible playbooks.

## Goal:
Deploy a basic HTTP server on my local machine using a simple automation script. This, I think, will lay the groundwork for understanding infrastructure provisioning and prepare me to use tools like Ansible, Terraform, and Docker.


## Run Instructions
```bash
cd scripts
bash start_server.sh

Then visit: http://localhost:8000

Project Layout
scripts/: Contains automation and server code
config/: HTML content served by the server
tests/: Basic tests to check server status
